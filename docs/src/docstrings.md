# Docstrings

`ToggleMenus` is not yet stable.  By its nature, effective use involves the
internals of the package, so the public interface is not easy to separate from
the specifics of the structs documented below. Aspects of the package demonstrated
in the [documentation proper](index.md) won't change without some good reason.

Any changes to those specifics will involve a minor release (or a major bump to 1.0),
and will be clearly documented in a `NEWS.md` file added to the base of the repository.

```@autodocs
Modules = [ToggleMenus]
